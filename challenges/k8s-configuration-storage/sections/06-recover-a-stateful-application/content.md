# Recover a Stateful Application

Storage issues are one of the most common causes of Pod failures in stateful configurations. When a Pod references a PersistentVolumeClaim that doesn't exist, cannot be bound, or has access conflicts, it gets stuck in `ContainerCreating`, `Pending`, or `CrashLoopBackOff` state.

## Triage Storage Errors

To diagnose storage and mount errors:
1. **Get Pod Status**: See if the pod is stuck:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```
2. **Describe Pod**: Look for storage warning events:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod db-pod
   ```
   Look for warnings like:
   - `FailedMount`: Volume mount failed (e.g. storage driver error, lock conflicts).
   - `FailedScheduling`: Could not match nodes (e.g. PV is located in zone-a, but pod was scheduled to zone-b).
   - `volume... not found`: The claimName referenced in Pod volumes does not exist in the namespace.

## Resolving Missing Claim Failures

If a Pod references a non-existent claim name, you must create a PersistentVolumeClaim with the exact matching metadata name in that namespace. Once the claim is created, the control plane binds it to a PersistentVolume, and the node's kubelet immediately mounts it, allowing the container to start.
